Description of Program: This program takes the name and age of the user, and outputs if they are a child, teenager, or adult. 
In more detail, it asks for the user's name as input and their age as an input. Depending on the age inputted, the program will output: "You are a child", "You are a teenager", or "You are an adult". A child will be 0-13 years old, a teenager will be 14-18 years old, and an adult will be any age from 19 and above.

A second program, TaxRate, takes your income and tax rate as a percentage, and calculates your income after taxes.


We picked the specific code of conduct, GNU PL because it is a copyleft license that will guarantee other developers the freedom to take the program and modify it in any way they want, as long as they then distribute that altered version as free software. This license allows our project to remain accessible, in any modified forms. It allows the program's code to be used by anyone but also ensures that the modified verisons of the code are also released as open-source products, which is avaliable to the public.
