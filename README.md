Description of Program: This program takes the name and age of the user, and outputs if they are a child, teenager, or adult. 
In more detail, it asks for the user's name as input and their age as an input. Depending on the age inputted, the program will output: "You are a child", "You are a teenager", or "You are an adult". A child will be 0-13 years old, a teenager will be 14-18 years old, and an adult will be any age from 19 and above.

A second program, TaxRate, takes your income and tax rate as a percentage, and calculates your income after taxes.
