#Using the program
This program takes the name and age of the user, and outputs if they are a child, teenager, or adult. No outside packages are required to be installed to run this program, outside of having Python 3.8 installed on your device. To install Python, visit [this site](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
In more detail, Lab6 asks for the user's name as input and their age as an input. Depending on the age inputted, the program will output: "You are a child", "You are a teenager", or "You are an adult". A child will be 0-13 years old, a teenager will be 14-18 years old, and an adult will be any age from 19 and above.

A second program, TaxRate, takes your income and tax rate as a percentage, and calculates your income after taxes.
